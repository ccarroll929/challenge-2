# H1 **Project Title:** Module 2 Challenge - Building a Portfolio Website

**Description:** In this project I created a website designed to showcase my portfolio so potential employers can easily view my completed projects/applications. My goal is for the website to be interactive and easily navigated by utilizing navigation links to different sections on the page, image links to my deployed applications, and ensuring the layout is responsive and adapts to various screen sizes and devices.
